# A reduced-order model for performance-based seismic design of suspended piping systems in buildings

Data and code in support of the publication "A reduced-order model for performance-based seismic design
of suspended piping systems in buildings", by Roberto J. Merino, Roberto Gentile and Carmine Galasso.

The repository contains:
- **the paper's original code and results**, unchanged, in `code implementation for paper/`;
- **`piperom`**, a reusable engine and web app implementing the same reduced-order model with
  file-based inputs. It's validated against the paper's code and results.

## Quick start

Requires Python 3.12 (tested on macOS arm64).

```bash
python3.12 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# command line: pushover and SDOF of a paper archetype
python -m piperom pushover inputs/archetypes/M01x.yaml      # → piperom_output/M01x/pushover/
python -m piperom sdof     inputs/archetypes/M01x.yaml --delta-c 12

# web app
streamlit run app/streamlit_app.py                          # → http://localhost:8501
```

The time-history analyses also need the floor motions (about 750 MB to download, 2 GB unzipped, not in
git). They are on Zenodo, [10.5281/zenodo.23283900](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23283900), with the OpenSees model of the building and its ground motions. Download
them into `motions/floor_motions/` with:

```bash
python -m piperom download-motions          # both sets; --sets S4_IM or --sets S4_150 for one
```

Then:

```bash
python -m piperom timehistory inputs/archetypes/M01x.yaml --levels 1,5,10
python -m piperom verify3d M01 --level 10 --pair 0
```

Checks: `pytest`, `python validation/run_validation.py`, `python validation/run_timehistory_validation.py`.

## Documentation

All documentation is in [`docs/`](docs/).

| Document | Summary |
|---|---|
| [Methodology](docs/methodology.md) | **What the engine computes.** A system file describes one loading direction: a straight main line on gravity hangers, transverse trapezes at chosen hangers, and orthogonal branches lumped into one DOF each. The engine runs (1) the iterative equivalent static procedure at a target displacement Δc, (2) an adaptive pseudo-pushover over a Δc range, (3) the equivalent SDOF at a chosen Δc (effective mass, Pinching4 springs scaled by Γ·φ), (4) SDOF nonlinear time histories under floor motions, with support demands, and (5) a verification against the paper's full 3D models. Also covers scope, limits and validation status. |
| [Software architecture](docs/architecture.md) | **How the code is organised.** Data layer (`inputs`, `trapeze`, `motions`), model layer (`static_model`, OpenSees), analysis layer (`pushover`, `sdof`, `timehistory`, `verification3d`), interfaces (`cli`, `jobs`, app). The engine reads only `inputs/` and `motions/`; defaults are defined once; the port is exact and regression-tested; OpenSees runs in worker processes for the app. |
| [Modules](docs/modules/) | **One file per `piperom` module:** [package](docs/modules/package.md) · [cli](docs/modules/cli.md) · [inputs](docs/modules/inputs.md) · [trapeze](docs/modules/trapeze.md) · [static_model](docs/modules/static_model.md) · [pushover](docs/modules/pushover.md) · [sdof](docs/modules/sdof.md) · [timehistory](docs/modules/timehistory.md) · [motions](docs/modules/motions.md) · [verification3d](docs/modules/verification3d.md) · [jobs](docs/modules/jobs.md). Responsibility, interface, design notes and tests of each. |
| [Inputs](docs/input_files.md) | **How to provide inputs, from the CLI and the app.** System YAML (hangers as grid or positions; braces as mask, positions or count; branches as list or CSV), trapeze CSV (Pinching4 format), settings YAML (all defaults in `inputs/defaults/`), the floor-motion catalogue `motions/motion_sets.yaml`, 3D model files; every CLI command and its outputs. |
| [App](docs/app.md) | **The web app, tab by tab.** Load or upload a system, edit geometry and trapezes with a plan view, adjust settings, run the pseudo-pushover, derive the SDOF, run SDOF time histories over chosen motion sets, levels and records, and run the 3D verification against the reduced-order prediction. Inputs and results can be downloaded. |
| [Validation](docs/validation.md) | **The engine against the scripts and their stored results** (commit c13ed81 and the corrections of 2026-10-09). Archetype inputs identical to the pushover drivers; pseudo-pushover of all 18 archetypes identical to their files; SDOF parameters identical to `sdof_from_2d.py` and to the proposed procedure; SDOF pushover, SDOF time histories (all 7920 archetype runs and the 150 runs of the proposed procedure, collapse flags included) and 3D verification identical to the stored precision. How to rerun every check. |
| [Paper code](docs/paper_code.md) | The contents of `code implementation for paper/` and what replaces each part in `piperom`. |
| [Known issues of the paper code](docs/legacy_issues.md) | Bugs and inconsistencies found in the original scripts, and how `piperom` handles each. |
